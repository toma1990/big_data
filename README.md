# big_data

Code from the Big Data module at the Unversity of Lincoln. The code not only analyzes the data and gives various values but also splits the data into training and test data sets and uses various machine learning models where the error rate, sensitivity and specificity were calculated. A larger dataset has also been used where the maximum, minimum and mean have been analyzed using mapReduce
